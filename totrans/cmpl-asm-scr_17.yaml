    use an off-the-shelf component, such as Boehm–Demers–Weiser garbage collector
    (or Boehm GC) which is available as a library. You can link this library and replace
    all the calls to `malloc` with `GC_malloc` from Boehm GC, and you’re done!

    named after Chris J. Cheney. Here’s a simplified description of it. We will get
    to more details in the following sections.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At program startup, a large memory area is allocated (for example, using `malloc`
    from `libc`). This area is referred to as a *semi-space*. You will see why shortly.
    Our existing use of `malloc` for allocating arrays is replaced with a new function,
    that we call `allocate`, which places the allocations (also called *blocks*) one
    after another in the semi-space. Once there’s not enough memory in the semi-space
    for allocation, a function we call `collect` is run. It allocates a new semi-space
    and copies there only *live* objects from the old semi-space. The old semi-space
    is referred to as the *from-space*, and the new one is referred to as the *to-space*.
    The objects are *live* if they are reachable (by pointers) from the so-called
    *roots*. The *roots* are pointers that point to objects that we know we want to
    keep ahead of time. Examples of such pointers are pointers on the stack and in
    global variables. When all live objects are copied to the to-space, the from-space
    is discarded (for example, using `free`).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When we run out of space again, we `malloc` a new semi-space. Now the old semi-space
    that used to be the to-space becomes the from-space, and the process repeats.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first challenge is to figure out which objects are live. The other challenge
    is that when we copy blocks their addresses change, and that means that we need
    to update all pointers that point to those objects.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We will start by writing a custom allocator function that will replace our current
    use of `malloc`. Instead of calling `malloc` for each allocation, we will allocate
    a larger memory region and then will allocate many arrays (or other objects) there.
    Such a memory region is usually—confusingly—called a *heap*, but in the context
    of Cheney’s algorithm, it is typically referred to as a *semi-space*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When talking about garbage collectors, we call individual spans of memory *blocks*.
    Our flat, non-resizable arrays are precisely one block each. Still, more complicated
    data structures (such as resizable arrays that we also talked about) could be
    implemented as several blocks connected with pointers. In this chapter, we’ll
    use the term *block*, even though for our simple language it is synonymous with
    an array.

    be used to hold global variables. For example, we can reserve, say, `r10` to hold
    a particular global variable. We can agree that we won’t use this register for
    anything else in our code generator. Foreign function will also keep it put, since
    it is a call-preserved register. Registers are a precious resource, but sometimes
    it makes sense to reserve one of them for something important. It is common to
    assign the *allocation pointer* to a register this way.

    allocation pointer, however, will change with each allocation. It starts out pointing
    at the same address as the semi-space start, and with each allocation moves towards
    the semi-space end.

- en: Now we can implement the `allocate` function. When it is called (with a number
    of bytes to allocate), we check if the area between the allocation pointer and
    the space end is enough to hold it. Then, we increment the allocation pointer
    by the requested number of bytes and return the previous value of the allocation
    pointer as the result. In other words, with each allocation, we pack blocks one
    after another from semi-space start to semi-space end.

    previously allocated in our semi-space. Those blocks have pointers between them
    (for example, an array with a nested array). The pointers may have cycles (an
    array element points to the array itself). The non-pointer words (left blank)
    hold some scalar data like numbers or booleans (both on the stack and in the semi-space).

    such word in a block a *header*. (Headers usually occupy one or two words and
    can contain more data, such as object type, for example.) In the figure, we denote
    each header with a letter “`H`” and group the words in the same block using rounded
    corners, so we can see the length of the block. From the figure, you can see that
    we have allocated five blocks with lengths two and three words.

    is the last frame in our program and stop. There are also ways to achieve that

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, it offers fast allocation. Most of the time, allocation only needs to
    check that there’s enough space left, and increment the allocation pointer—that’s
    it! This can be implemented in a hand-full of instructions and can be made even
    faster if the allocation pointer is assigned a dedicated call-preserved register.
    Compare this to `malloc` where a typical implementation needs to execute 50 to
    200 instructions before returning.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Second, it’s a *compacting* or *moving* collector. After the collection phase,
    all the blocks are allocated one-after-another without holes or fragmentation.
    This is good for data locality and cache performance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But not everything is perfect with this algorithm.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is a *stop-the-world*, *non-concurrent* collector. When collection happens,
    the program is paused until the collection finishes. In a concurrent collector,
    the collection happens a-little–at-a-time with each allocation, to avoid long
    pauses.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another property of this algorithm is that during the collection, when both
    semi-spaces are allocated the amount of memory consumed is twice as high.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is observed that new blocks often become garbage fast. And then some blocks
    stay around for a long time. We want to scan new blocks more frequently to reclaim
    memory and scan older blocks more rarely, since they are less likely to become
    garbage. This can be achieved with *generational* collectors.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'For example, a collector with two generations G0 and G1 may have two heaps
    or spaces: a smaller one for G0 and a larger one for G1\. Collections happen more
    frequently in G0 and more rarely in G1\. They can also use different algorithms.
    All new objects are allocated in G0, and after G0 collection happens, the blocks
    that remained are copied to G1.'
