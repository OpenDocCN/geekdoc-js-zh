    to understand how compilers work, and maybe even want to write one. Nevertheless,
    here’s a list of some of the reasons to do it:'

    and they are not magic made by gods.

- en: The topic of compiler construction is the single most researched topic in computer
    science. Nothing else comes close. So there’s a massive amount of useful techniques
    and algorithms in compiler literature. And it turns out, a lot of it is very applicable
    to our day-to-day programming. There’s also a school of thought that, in the end,
    maybe all programs are compilers. Maybe we are not writing web apps, for example,
    but compilers from DOM nodes to JSON and from JSON to SQL, who knows!

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The book describes the design and implementation of a compiler written in TypeScript,
    which compiles a small language to 32-bit ARM assembly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The book consists of two parts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Part I* describes the design and development of a minimal *baseline compiler*
    in great detail. We call it a *baseline compiler* because it lays the foundation
    for developing more advanced features introduced in *Part II*. The *implementation
    language* of the compiler is TypeScript. But the compiler’s *source* or *input*
    language is a *subset* (or a simplified version) of TypeScript. This subset consists
    of things common to any practical programming language, not specific to TypeScript:
    arithmetic and comparison operators, integer numbers, functions, conditional statements
    and loops, local variables, and assignments. We call this language the *baseline
    language*. It can express simple programs and functions, like this one, for example:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE0]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: '*Part II* builds upon the *baseline compiler* and describes various *compiler
    extensions* in lesser detail. Those extensions are often mutually exclusive (like
    static typing and dynamic typing), but they all use the baseline compiler as the
    foundation.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Appendix A* describes how to run the ARM assembly code the compiler produces.
    You can skip this if you’re developing your compiler on a computer which is based
    on an ARM processor with a 32-bit operating system like Raspberry Pi OS (formerly
    Raspbian). However, if you are running an x86-64 system like those from Intel
    and AMD, you need to see *Appendix A*.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Appendix B* describes the differences between the two mainstream ARM assembly
    syntaxes: the GNU assembler (GAS) syntax, and the legacy ARMASM syntax.'

- en: Why ARM?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In many ways, the ARM instruction set is what makes this book possible.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Compared to Intel x86-64, the ARM instruction set is a work of art.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Intel x86-64 is the result of evolution from an 8-bit processor, to a 16-bit
    one, then to a 32-bit one, and finally to a 64-bit one. At each step of the evolution,
    it accumulated complexity and cruft. At each step, it tried to satisfy conflicting
    requirements.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Intel x86-64 is based on *Complex Instruction Set Architecture* (CISC), which
    was initially optimized for writing assembly by hand.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ARM, on the other hand, is based on *Reduced Instruction Set Architecture* (RISC),
    which is optimized for writing compilers.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Guess which one is an easier target for a compiler?*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If this book targeted x86-64 instead of ARM, it would have been two times as
    long and—more likely—never written. Also, with *hundreds* of *billions* devices
    shipped, we better get used to the fact that ARM is the dominant instruction set
    architecture today.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In other words, ARM is a good start. After learning it, you will be better equipped
    for moving to x86-64 or the newer ARM64.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book describes the design and development of a compiler written in TypeScript,
    which compiles a small language that also uses TypeScript syntax.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The compiler doesn’t have to be written in TypeScript. It could be written in
    any language, but I had to pick. I have used a straightforward subset of TypeScript
    for the examples, to make it readable for anyone who knows one or more mainstream
    languages.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Part I* is structured linearly, with each chapter building upon the previous
    one. However, don’t feel guilty skipping chapters if you are already familiar
    with a topic.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you plan to follow along and implement the compiler described in this book
    (or a similar one), I recommend first to read *Part I* without writing any code.
    Then you can go back to the beginning and start implementing the compiler while
    skimming *Part I* again.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The book uses the *parser combinators* approach to create the parser; however,
    if you know a different technique, feel free to use it instead.
