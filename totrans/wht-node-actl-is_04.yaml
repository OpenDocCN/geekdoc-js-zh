    call stack. Think of it as a stack of plates. Every time you call a function,

    all the function's arguments and local variables.

    that kicks off the loop.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Different operating systems have their own super-efficient ways of handling async
    operations. Linux has `epoll`, macOS has `kqueue`, and Windows has its I/O Completion
    Ports (IOCP). These are kernel-level tools that let a program say, "Hey, watch
    these files and network sockets for me, and just wake me up when something interesting
    happens." Libuv provides a single, beautiful C API that works on top of all these
    different systems. This is why your `http.createServer` code runs performantly
    everywhere without you having to change a single line. When you tell Node to listen
    on a port, it''s Libuv making the right non-blocking call to the OS.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**The Thread Pool.** Okay, this is a common point of confusion, so lean in.
    We say Node is single-threaded, but that''s only half the story. Your JavaScript
    runs on a single thread, yes. But Libuv maintains its own small, internal pool
    of threads. Why? Because as great as modern OSes are, some operations are just
    unavoidably, stubbornly blocking. This includes most file system stuff, some DNS
    lookups, and a few CPU-intensive crypto functions. If Node ran these on the main
    thread, they''d block the loop - game over. Instead, Libuv cleverly delegates
    these specific jobs to its thread pool. A worker thread from the pool makes the
    slow, blocking system call. When it''s done, it signals the main event loop, which
    can then finally execute your JavaScript callback. The default size of this pool
    is four, but you can change it with the `UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE` environment variable
    (a very handy trick to know!).'

    a highly structured, multi-phase cycle. Each full lap through this cycle is called
    a "tick." Getting your head around these phases is the absolute key to understanding
    why async operations execute in the order they do. Libuv's loop is just a repeating
    journey through these six core phases.

    has callbacks waiting, it will execute them one by one, in First-In, First-Out
    (FIFO) order, until the queue is empty or some system-dependent limit is hit.
    Then, it shuffles along to the next phase. Simple as that.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, technically, a timer callback isn't guaranteed to run at the *exact* millisecond
    you specified. The delay you provide is the *minimum* time until the callback
    is eligible to run. When the loop enters this phase, it checks the clock. Has
    the time for any of our scheduled timers passed? If so, their callbacks are run.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You might be wondering how Node can handle thousands of timers without constantly
    checking a giant list. It’s cleverer than that. Libuv uses a special data structure
    called a **min-heap**. A min-heap is a tree-like structure where the smallest
    element is always at the root. In this context, "smallest" means the timer that's
    set to expire next. This lets Libuv know how long it can "sleep" until the next
    timer is due in O(1) time - incredibly fast. This is a huge reason why Node's
    timers are so cheap.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ℹ️Note
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Libuv uses a min-heap so the next-expiring timer can be discovered in O(1) time,
    but inserting or removing timers is O(log n). That makes timers efficient for
    large sets, but creating or canceling many timers still has non-zero cost.

    `epoll_wait` on Linux). This is the only "blocking" part of the event loop, but
    it''s a good kind of blocking. The process uses zero CPU, just patiently waiting

    concurrent connections.

    scaling your entire application across multiple CPU cores by running multiple,
    independent process instances of it. This is highly effective for your servers,

    loop then starts up. The `setTimeout(..., 0)` doesn't really have a 0ms delay;
    it's constrained by a system minimum, often around 1ms. When the loop enters the
    timers phase, it checks if that 1ms has elapsed. If the initial startup of the
    loop took more than 1ms (which is totally possible on a busy system), the timer
    will fire first. If startup was super fast, the loop will fly past the (still
    empty) timers phase, hit the poll phase, and then the check phase, running the
    `setImmediate` first. It's a race condition.

    What's the very next phase? The check phase. So the `setImmediate` callback is
    guaranteed to run. The timer callback has to wait until the loop completes its
    full cycle and comes back around to the timers phase on the *next tick*.
