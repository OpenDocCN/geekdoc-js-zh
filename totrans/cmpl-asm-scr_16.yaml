- en: With dynamic typing, you expect to be able to query the data type of any variable,
    using `instanceof` or some other mechanism. Right now we can’t distinguish at
    run time between a number and (a pointer to) an array. With the static type system
    we have, it doesn’t matter, because such comparison is disallowed at run time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, how do we distinguish a pointer from a number, a false from zero, and so
    on? This is typically achieved with *tagging*.

    for example, to distinguish its type.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Pointer tag
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We expect pointers to be word-aligned. That means that the last two bits in
    a word will always be `0b00`. That means we can store a two-bit tag there to distinguish
    pointers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The simplest way to deal with that is to select the tag `0b00`. And that’s
    what many implementations do. But we can also select a different tag, like `0b01`,
    as we did. In the general case, when we want to operate on a pointer, we can remove
    the tag, do the operations, then put it back, if necessary. However, having a
    tag of `0b01` simply means that we point to the second byte in the word. So, to
    load the first word, instead of loading at offset `0`, we can load at offset `-1`.
    This way `ldr r0, [r1]` becomes `ldr r0, [r1, #-1]`, and `ldr r0, [r1, #4]` becomes
    `ldr r0, [r1, #3]` and so on! This means that not much is lost. At worst, it takes
    one instruction to clear the tag.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The only kind of pointers we handle right now are array pointers. To distinguish
    them from other heap-allocated objects, it is common to encode information about
    the object type in the data structure itself.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If we dedicate two bits for tagging, that means that our integers shrink from
    32-bit ones to 30-bit ones. That’s an oddly-sized integer! However, in dynamically-typed
    languages, integers are often silently promoted to floating-point numbers or arbitrary-precision
    numbers. That means the fact that an integer is 30-bit is not exposed to the user
    of the language. These oddly-sized integers are called *small integers*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, of course, to deal with small integers we can remove the tags, perform an
    operation and then add the tag. However, that’s not always necessary either. We
    have selected the tag `0b00` for integers. That means that most arithmetic and
    logic operations will work on such tagged integers as-is. For example, `3 + 4
    = 7` used to be `0b11 + 0b100 = 0b111`, but now it’s `0b11_00 + 0b100_00 = 0b111_00`.
    (We have used underscores to separate the tag and the value visually.) One notable
    exception to this is multiplication, which requires one instruction—shift right—to
    fix it up, and even then there are ways to incorporate that shift “for free” as
    a part of another instruction.

    the falsy and truthy values, correspondingly. This is to highlight the fact that
    tags are often selected in creative ways to simplify common operations. We only
    have `true`, `false`, and `undefined` left in our language. We will assign them
    values `0b1_11`, `0b1_10`, and `0b0_10`, correspondingly. This also allows us
    to quickly check if a value is boolean by checking that the bits `0b1_10` are
    set.'

- en: Previously, the type system enforced that the operators are used with the right
    data types. For example, the addition was only allowed on numbers. Now, we need
    to define addition so that it works (to some extent) with any types. For instance,
    JavaScript has complicated coercion rules. If you add an empty array `[]` and
    a number `1` the result is a string `"1"`. For our compiler, we’ll adopt simplified
    coercion rules. If the two operands are numbers, the result is a number, otherwise—`undefined`.

    for the first time. With our tagging system, a word is falsy if it is zero, or
    ends with a falsy tag `0b10`. That’s why we need to perform two comparisons.

    we accomplish the same and add a `0b01` tag at the same time using `add r0, r4,

    with last two bits being `0b00`.'
