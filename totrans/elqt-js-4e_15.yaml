    for other computers to start talking to it. To be able to listen for different
    kinds of communication at the same time on a single machine, each listener has
    a number (called a *port*) associated with it. Most protocols specify which port
    should be used by default. For example, when we want to send an email using the
    SMTP protocol, the machine through which we send it is expected to be listening
    on port 25.'

    machine using the correct port number. If the target machine can be reached and

    computer is called the *server*, and the connecting computer is called the *client*.

    on both ends can put data into it. Once the bits are successfully transmitted,
    they can be read out again by the machine on the other side. This is a convenient
    model. You could say that TCP provides an abstraction of the network.

    declares that the title of this document is “My home page” and that it uses the
    UTF-8 encoding, which is a way to encode Unicode text as binary data. The document’s

    in the form of name=“value” pairs. These are called *attributes*. In this case,

    have a special meaning in HTML, yet another form of special notation has to be
    introduced. A plain opening angle bracket is written as &lt; (“less than”), and
    a closing bracket is written as &gt; (“greater than”). In HTML, an ampersand (&)
    character followed by a name or character code and a semicolon (;) is called an
    *entity* and will be replaced by the character it encodes.
